    IN THE HIGH COURT FOR THE STATES OF PUNJAB &amp;
              HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH.

                               CWP No.6430 of 2008
                               Date of decision: January 12, 2009

Agyakar Singh                                       ...Petitioner

                         Versus

Punjab State Electricity Board and others          ...Respondents

CORAM:      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH MOHUNTA
            HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJAN GUPTA

Present:    Mr. Vipin Mahajan, Advocate, for the petitioner.
            Mr. Rajiv Malhotra, Advocate, for the respondents.

Rajan Gupta, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            The petitioner has sought a writ in the nature of certiorari

for quashing a charge-sheet issued to him on 30th November, 2005,

Annexure P-8 on the ground that he has been punished twice for the

same charge. The petitioner has also sought quashing of the inquiry

report, Annexure P-13 and the show cause notice, Annexure P-17.

</p><p id="p_2">            The petitioner was inducted as a lineman in the Punjab

State Electricity Board on 19th October, 1985. On 9th June, 1987 his

services were terminated.    The petitioner challenged his termination

order by way of a civil suit before the Civil Judge, Kapurthala. The said

suit was dismissed on 17th March, 1990. The petitioner preferred an

appeal before the District Judge, Kapurthala against the said decision

which was also dismissed on 27th May, 1992. Thereafter, the petitioner

preferred a Regular Second Appeal which was registered as RSA

No.1561 of 1992. The second appeal was admitted to regular hearing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CWP No.6430 of 2008                           2</span>


by this court on 21st September, 1992. The petitioner was, however,

taken back in service on 16th January, 2000 vide order dated 27th

February, 2001, Annexure P-2. The petitioner thereafter withdrew the

RSA preferred by him and the same was dismissed as withdrawn on 29th

August, 2001. On 30th November, 2005, a charge-sheet was issued to

the petitioner for having submitted a bogus certificate at the time of his

appointment. An Enquiry Officer was appointed who opined that a

compromise had been arrived at between the petitioner and the Board

and in view of the same the charge-sheet be dropped. The matter was,

however, remanded back to the Enquiry Officer. The said officer after

holding a detailed inquiry came to the conclusion that the experience

certificate produced by the petitioner at the time of his initial

appointment was forged and, therefore, the said charge stood proved.

He recommended disciplinary action against the petitioner. A notice

was thereafter issued to the petitioner as disciplinary action was

proposed to be taken against him.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Reply has been filed on behalf of the Board wherein it has

defended its action in issuing charge-sheet to the petitioner for

producing a bogus certificate at the time of his initial selection. It has

also been stated that the decision of their administrative member to

reinstate the petitioner in service was reviewed in a meeting of the

whole time members in exercise of power conferred by Regulation 32 of

the Punjab State Electricity Board (Employees Punishment and Appeal

Regulations), 1971 and it was decided to initiate regular inquiry against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No.6430 of 2008                              3</span>


the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             We have heard learned counsel for the parties and given our

thoughtful consideration to the entire matter.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             It is apparent from the record that at the time of his initial

appointment as Lineman, the petitioner produced a bogus experience

certificate. The certificate was to the effect that Agyakar Singh (the

petitioner) had served in PSEB Sub Division, TLSC, Batala from 1st

June, 1977 to 12th July, 1978 as work charge TMM for a total period of

408 days. The certificate was issued allegedly by SDO, PSEB, TLSC,

Batala. It was a Vigilance Department of PSEB which found that the

petitioner had never worked as work charge TMM in the said Sub

Division during the period 1st June, 1977 to 12th July, 1978.          The

Vigilance thus came to the conclusion that the experience certificate

produced by the petitioner was forged. Later on, in the inquiry held

pursuant to the disciplinary proceedings, the Enquiry Officer also found

the certificate to be forged.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             We thus find no substance in the submission of the counsel

that the petitioner has been punished twice for the same charge. In fact,

the services of the petitioner were terminated way back in the year 1987.

He was suddenly taken back in service in 2001 despite the fact that in

the civil litigation initiated by the petitioner, the stand of the Board had

been vindicated.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             In the judgment of the apex court reported as Bank of

India and Anr. Vs. Avinash D. Mandivikar and Ors., (2005) 7 S.C.C.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CWP No.6430 of 2008                           4</span>


690, it was held that a person who seeks equity must come with clean

hands. Equity jurisdiction cannot be exercised in the case of a person

who gets appointment on the basis of a false certificate or by playing

fraud. No sympathy or equitable consideration can come to rescue of

such a person. It was further held that compassion cannot be allowed to

bend the arms of law where an individual acquired a status by practicing

fraud. Fraud and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in

any civilized system of jurisprudence.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            In this view of the matter, we find no ground to interfere in

the present case and the writ petition is hereby dismissed.

</p><p id="p_9">            However, before parting with the judgment, we may notice

with concern that due to the decision taken by the administrative

member of the Board, the petitioner was reinstated in service vide order

dated 27th February, 2001 and was able to continue in service thereafter.

This is despite the fact that the petitioner had lost the civil litigation

before two courts below where the Board had opposed the claim of the

petitioner. His Regular Second Appeal before this court was merely

admitted to regular hearing. There was no interim order in the same.

The administrative member despite being aware of the fact that the

petitioner had secured appointment on the basis of a bogus certificate,

decided to reinstate him in service. The petitioner was thus able to work

with the Board and able to draw salary from the year 2001 onwards.

After a charge-sheet was issued to the petitioner, the Enquiry Officer

submitted a report vide Annexure P-13 wherein he observed that a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No.6430 of 2008                           5</span>


compromise had been arrived at between the petitioner and the Board

and, therefore, the charge-sheet deserved to withdraw.

</p><p id="p_10">            It is inexplicable how the administrative member issued the

order dated 7th February, 2001 reinstating the petitioner in service

despite the fact that he was aware that the petitioner had secured

appointment on the basis of a forged certificate.     It is also surprising

that the Inquiry Officer opined in his inquiry report, Annexure P-13 that

there had been a compromise between the petitioner and the Board. It is

evident that both these officers acted against the interest of the Board

and in total violation of law. We fail to understand how there can be a

compromise between an employee who secures appointment on the

basis of a forged certificate and the Board. Such a compromise between

a delinquent employee and an instrumentality of State, is unknown to

law.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            In the facts and circumstances of the case, we direct that in

case at the time of culmination of the disciplinary proceedings, the

petitioner is held guilty, the Board shall fix responsibility for directing

his reinstatement in service. In case it is found that petitioner was not

entitled to be reinstated, the Board shall take a decision regarding

recovery of the amount paid to the petitioner as salary for the period he

was not entitled to remain in service.</p><pre id="pre_2">
