</pre>
<p id="p_1">K. Kannan, J(oral)

</p><p id="p_2">                  1.     The revision petitioner challenges the order of

eviction passed by the Appellate Authority accepting the contention of the

landlord on two counts that there was a valid lease executed by the tenant in

favour of the landlord undertaking to pay rent at the rate of Rs.2400/- per

month and (ii) there had been a default on the part of the tenant to pay the

rent as undertaken by him on the denial of the relationship between the

landlord and tenant setting up title in favour of third party i.e. Subhash

Sethi.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                  2.     The learned Senior counsel arguing on behalf of

the revision petitioner begins his argument with a concession that the tenant

will not any longer press the dispute regarding the entitlement of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CR No. 5474 of 2001                                2</span>

landlord to collect rent and that he would accept him to be his landlord and

not pressforth his plea that Subhash Sethi was the landlord. The learned Sr.

counsel urges two contentions i) if the tenancy for Rs. 2400/- were to be

accepted the Rent Controller ought to have before passing an order for

eviction for non-payment of rent followed the procedure laid down by the

Supreme Court in Rakesh Wadhawan 2002 (1) RCR 514. According to

him the Rent Controller ought to have afforded an opportunity to pay the

rent calculated and without such an opportunity eviction could not have

been issued. The counsel for the petitioner contended that he was ready to

pay the rent and continue the relationship with the landlord. The second

contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the revision petitioner is that a

clause for enhancement of rent at the rate of 10% per year was against

statute. The parties cannot contract themselves out of law and stipulation

for enhancement in the rent deed was invalid. The learned Senior counsel

referred me to the provisions of Section 6 and 7 of the East Punjab Rent

Restriction Act, 1949 which according to him contained a legislative

interdict against enhancement of rent against voluntary enhancement of rent.

</p><p id="p_4">                   3.    To take up the latter point first, Section 6 only lays

down that the landlord cannot claim anything in excess of "fair rent"

determined    under the Act as rent i.e. determined by reference to the

procedure under Section 4 of the Act. So long as fair rent is not fixed by

reference to the procedure, the operation of Section 6 of the Act is not

attracted. Similarly reference to Section 7 of the Act is also inappropriate,

for it only bars a landlord to claim any fine or price or any other like sum in

addition to the rent for consideration for the grant, renewal or continuation

of lease. Provisions for enhancement of rent does not fall within the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CR No. 5474 of 2001                                3</span>

boundaries of Section 7.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                  4.       Learned counsel also refers to the decision of the

Supreme Court in Bhoja Ram Vs. Rameshwar Agarwala and others JT

1993 (2) SC 375. This decision is also inapplicable because the Supreme

Court was dealing with the express provisions of "Bihar Lease Rent and

Eviction Control Act" which contained through Section 4 a clear bar for

enhancement of rent in the following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "4.      Enhancement of rent buildings:- Notwithstanding

                  anything contained in any agreement or law to the

                  contrary, it shall not be lawful for any landlord to

                  increase, or claim any increase in the rent which is

                  payable for the time being in respect of any building

                  except in accordance with the provisions of this Act."

</blockquote><p id="p_6">A similar provision such as <a href="/doc/667470/" id="a_1">Section 4</a> of the Bihar Act is not available under

the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 therefore the provisions

for enhancement of rent cannot be said to be barred under any of the

provisions of the East Punjab Rent Restriction Act.

</p><p id="p_7">                  5.       Learned counsel for the respondent refers to a

decision in Hardev Kaur deceased through legal representative Vs.

Ghazal,   Restaurant Chadigarh 1992 (2) PLR 660 where a Division

Bench of this Court stated that a lease deed stipulated that the tenant would

pay 10% increase on the expiry of three years was valid and that at the same

time adopted reasoning that if, however, a fair rent of the building has been

fixed by the Rent Controller, then landlord cannot claim increase in rent.

This proposition finds affirmation in another ruling of this Court in Ashok

Kumar Vs. Rakesh Garg C.R. No. 4202 of 2003 decided on 23.1.2006.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CR No. 5474 of 2001                                4</span>

</p><p id="p_8">                   6.    The residual point for consideration is the

procedural requirement of Court to afford an opportunity to a tenant to pay

rent before order of eviction on the ground of non-payment of rent. It has to

be borne in mind that this was an instance of a case of a tenant who, at all

times before the Rent Controller and the Appellate Authority denied

entitlement of the landlord, the claim to such status and he pleaded jus

tertii. A tenant would be barred by the provisions of Act under <a href="/doc/20238/" id="a_2">Section 116</a>

of the Evidence Act from denying the title of the landlord. The

preponderance of authorities allowing a tenant to plead paramount title in a

third party would be in cases when a tenant is dispossessed at the instance

of a holder of title paramount      and tenant subsequently attorns to the

paramount title holder. In no other occasion would it be possible for a

tenant to deny the jural relationship with his landlord. The legal

consequence of the denial forfeiting      a tenancy is also available under

<a href="/doc/1134872/" id="a_3">Section 111</a> of the Transfer and <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_4">Property Act</a> but the said Act contains a

distinct procedure for a landlord to act on the forfeiture by having to issue a

notice before taking an action for possession.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                   7.    The Rent Control legislation stipulates a procedure

which is distinct and the authorities that have dealt with the consequences

of denial of title have a direct bearing to a claim by the tenant that he shall

be given an opportunity to make the payment before eviction could be

ordered. This issue is also no longer res integra. Learned Sr. counsel for

the respondent cites three decisions of this Court that squarely cover the

issue: The decisions in Jagdamba Tea Factory, Amirtsar Vs. Parshotam

2008 (1) RCR 507, Preeti Vs. Manmohan Singh and another 2008 (1)

RCR 307 and 2004 (3) PLR 504 expound the principle that where a tenant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CR No. 5474 of 2001                               5</span>

denied the relationship of landlord and tenant and was not depositing the

rent but the landlord was able to prove relationship of landlord and tenant

during the trial, the tenant was liable for eviction on the ground of non-

payment. He was not required to be given an opportunity to pay rent after

relationship of landlord and tenant was proved. While so laying down the

law, they have also specifically ruled that the procedure laid down in

Rakesh Wadhawan's case (supra) did not apply.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                  8.     Here is a case where the tenant who set up title in a

third party and denied tenancy and who also contended that he was paying

only Rs. 1500/- was confronted by evidence that yet another tenant who was

prior to his occupation was paying Rs.1900/- p.m. The landlord wanted to

show a course of normal conduct that a landlord would not obtain eviction

from a tenant and hand-over to another tenant for a lesser rent. To me,

the contention of the tenant that he was      to pay only Rs. 1500/- was

patently wrong, absurd and untrue. On due consideration of all relevant

materials the Appellate Authority had clearly found that the plea of the

tenant denying the rent deed and setting up title in third party was not bona

fide.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                  9.     For all the discussion above, the revision petition

is wholly without merit and the same is dismissed with costs assessed at

Rs.5,000/-.
