The appellants, on  theother hand, contend that the factual position recorded by  the  Tribunal  iscontrary to the official record, which, however, was not placed  before  theTribunal or before this Court.  In that, the correct  factual  position  wasnot brought to the notice of the Tribunal and also this Court, in the  CivilAppeal filed before  this  Court  against  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal.Nevertheless,  considering  the  far  reaching  financial   and   structuralramifications for the Defence Forces and in larger public  interest,  it  isessential to examine the core issue about the applicability of  DACP  Schemeto  Commissioned  Officers  of  Armed  Forces.  It  is  submitted  that  thedepartment intends to proceed against the officials responsible  for  filingsuch inaccurate and deficient pleadings \u2013  which  entailed  in  recording  afinding that there was no denial that the DACP scheme is equally  applicableto AMC Cadre. There is ample contemporaneous record  to  indicate  that  theScheme was made applicable only to Civilian Doctors and not to  CommissionedOfficers serving  in  AMC  Cadre.  It  is  not  a  case  of  the  departmentapprobating and reprobating, but a case of an inaccurate  plea  being  takenbefore the Tribunal  which  led  to  the  said  finding.  If  the  officialsresponsible for filing such pleadings, in the departmental action are  foundto have done it intentionally, it would be a case bordering on  fraud.   Therecommendation made in respect of the DACP scheme by the 6th Pay  Commissionwas limited to Civilian Doctors (not in respect of Commissioned Officers  inthree Services). Besides the resolution passed by the  Ministry  of  Financedated 29th August 2008, bearing No.1/1/08-IC  made  it  explicit  that  DACPscheme  was  applicable  only  in  respect  of  civilian  employees  in  theorganized and unorganized sectors employed  by  the  Central  Government  asalso in the All India Services and to Chairpersons or Members of  regulatorybodies. Besides the said resolution, the Ministry of Finance, Department  ofExpenditure, Implementation Cell on 29th August 2008 vide its  communicationmade it amply clear to the Ministry of Defence that the  proposal  regardingimplementation of the Government decision of pay revision  qua  Officers  ofArmed Forces for grant of DACP to Doctors who are Commissioned  Officers  inAMC Cadre has been deleted as the same is not applicable to the  Doctors  inthe Defence Forces. The Ministry of  Defence  accordingly,  on  30th  August2008 issued a resolution extending the benefits of other  allowances  (otherthan DACP) for the Commissioned Officers in three  Services  as  recommendedby the 6th Pay Commission and approved by the Government.  In  other  words,the appropriate authority had consciously not extended the benefit  of  DACPScheme to Doctors who were Commissioned  Officers  in  AMC  Cadre.  Further,according to the appellants the recommendation of the 6th Pay Commission  togrant DACP to Doctors  was limited to Civilian Doctors and  not  to  Doctorswho were Commissioned Officers in AMC Cadre.  The  6th  Pay  Commission  hasprovided a large number of other allowances to Commissioned Officers in  AMCCadre.   It is stated that Armed Forces Medical Services is a tri \u2013  serviceorganization i.e. those who are commissioned as Doctors can be  employed  inany of the three services, namely (i) Indian Army,  (ii)  Indian  Navy,  and"

On the other hand, the Doctors serving  inMinistry of Defence are categorized as civilian medical doctors.

The fact that no express denial was stated  in  thepleadings filed before the Tribunal cannot be construed as admission of  theDepartment to extend DACP even to doctors working  in  AMC  Cadre.

The authorities were directed  to  issue  instructions  for  theimplementation of DACP scheme in the light of  Annexure  A-1,  A-2  and  A-3attached with the Original Application within three months from the date  ofreceipt of copy of the order. That direction will have to  be  construed  tomean that the authorities must act in accordance with law  and  extend  DACPscheme even to the Commissioned Officers of AMC  Cadre,  if  permissible  inlaw. No more and no less. Therefore, this Court whilst dismissing the  CivilAppeal on 23rd September 2011 observed that no substantial question  of  lawof general/public importance arises for consideration. That decision  cannotbe given an expansive meaning so as  to  be  read  that  de-hors  the  legalposition,  DACP scheme be extended even to doctors working  as  CommissionedOfficers in AMC Cadre.

                "14.   The next question is: whether this Court  should  itself  examine  thegamut of arguments regarding applicability of DACP Scheme  even  to  Doctorsserving as Commissioned Officers in AMC Cadre.  Indeed, the entire  materialhas now been placed before us, on the basis of which, it may be possible  toanswer the matters in issue.  The  appellants  have  relied  on  the  OfficeMemorandum dated 29th August, 2008 issued by the  Ministry  of  Finance  andthe resolution issued by the Ministry of Defence dated  30th  August,  2008.The former Office Memorandum including the Office  Noting  on  the  file  atdifferent levels, prima facie, indicates that there was  a  clear  exclusionof applicability of DACP Scheme to Doctors working as Commissioned  Officersin AMC Cadre.  In addition, our attention has been invited to the  referencemade to the 6th Pay Commission and the specific recommendation made  by  the6th Pay Commission for civilian doctors  and  separate  recommendations  forthe Commissioned Officers of AMC Cadre.  Since the Tribunal has  not  eitherin the case of Col. Sanjeev Sehgal  (supra)  or  in  the  impugned  decisionexamined all these  aspects  on  its  merits,  we  deem  it  appropriate  torelegate the parties before the Tribunal for reconsideration of  the  entirematter afresh without being influenced  by  the  observations  made  in  theorder passed in case of Col. Sanjeev Sehgal  (supra)  or  the  dismissal  ofappeal against that decision by this Court on 23rd September, 2011.  We  sayso because we are of the considered opinion that  the  direction  issued  bythe Tribunal in the case of Col. Sanjeev Sehgal (supra)  to  the  Departmentfor  issuing  instructions  was  obviously  to  decide   the   issue   underconsideration in accordance with law, on the question  of  applicability  ofDACP Scheme even to the Doctors working  as  Commissioned  Officers  in  AMCCadre.  As noted in the earlier part of the judgment, controversy  has  far-reaching structural ramifications to  the  Armed  Forces  besides  financialimplications and the possibility of a discrimination  within  the  cadre  ifadditional benefit was to be given only to Doctors working  as  CommissionedOfficers in AMC Cadre and not to other Commissioned Officers working on  thesame rank. This requires deeper consideration.  For that reason, this  Courtduring  the  pendency  of  these  appeals  had  permitted  the   appropriateauthority to examine the  entire  matter  and  take  a  necessary  decision.Pursuant to that liberty,  the Deputy Secretary (Medical)  of  the  Ministryof Defence, Government of  India,  has  informed  of  the  decision  of  theGovernment vide communication dated 13th  January,  2016  to  the  Chairman,Chiefs of Staff  Committee  (COSC).   It  would  be  open  to  the  originalapplicants (respondents in the appeals) to question the correctness  thereofin the remanded proceedings.  This would  provide  an  opportunity  to  bothsides to pursue their pleas and also facilitate the Tribunal to examine  thecorrectness of the position and answer the matters in issue appropriately."
