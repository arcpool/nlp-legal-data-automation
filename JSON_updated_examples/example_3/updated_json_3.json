We have given our thoughtful consideration, to  the  submissionsadvanced at the behest of the learned counsel for  the  rival  parties.  Theonly question, that arises for consideration at our hands, is the date  fromwhich arrears should  be  released  to  the  respondents.   Insofar  as  theinstant aspect of the matter is concerned, during  the  course  of  hearing,Ms.  Indu  Malhotra,  learned  senior  counsel  representing  the  State  ofHaryana, had invited our attention to the  Constitution  Bench  judgment  ofthis Court in State of Karnataka vs. Umadevi, (2006) 4 SCC  1,  wherein,  onthe subject in question, this Court had observed as under:\u201d55. In cases relating to service in the Commercial  Taxes  Department,  theHigh Court has directed that those engaged on daily  wages,  be  paid  wagesequal to the salary and allowances  that  are  being  paid  to  the  regularemployees of their cadre in government service, with effect from  the  datesfrom which they were respectively appointed. The objection taken was to  thedirection for payment from the dates of engagement. We find  that  the  HighCourt had clearly gone wrong in  directing  that  these  employees  be  paidsalary equal to the salary  and  allowances  that  are  being  paid  to  theregular employees of their cadre in government  service,  with  effect  fromthe dates from which they were respectively engaged  or  appointed.  It  wasnot open to the High Court to impose such an obligation on  the  State  whenthe very question before the High Court  in  the  case  was  whether   theseemployees were entitled to have equal pay for equal work so-called and  wereentitled to any other benefit. They had also been engaged in  the  teeth  ofdirections not to do so. We are, therefore, of the view that, at  best,  theDivision Bench of the High Court should have directed that  wages  equal  tothe salary that is being paid to regular employees be paid  to  these  dailywage employees with effect from the date of its judgment. Hence,  that  partof the direction of the Division Bench is modified and it is  directed  thatthese daily-wage earners be paid wages equal to the  salary  at  the  lowestgrade of employees of their cadre in  the  Commercial  Taxes  Department  ingovernment service, from the date of the judgment of the Division  Bench  ofthe High Court.\u201d                                       (emphasis is ours)Having perused the determination rendered by this  Court  in  the  Umadevi'scase (supra), we are  satisfied,  that  in  terms  of  the  above  judgment,arrears should have been held, to be payable to the respondents,  only  witheffect from the  date  when  the  impugned  judgment  was  rendered  by  theDivision Bench of the High Court, i.e., with effect from 1.4.2013.   We  areindeed bound to follow the aforesaid declared position, by the  ConstitutionBench of this Court. More so because, the legal position on the subject  wasuncertain, in view of the conflicting position reflected on the subject,  bydifferent judgments of the High  Court.   The  correct  legal  position  wasdeclared for the first time, through the impugned judgment, which also  heldthe statutory  rules  framed  under  Article  309  of  the  Constitution  asunconstitutional, to the extent of payment of wages. It is on the above  andallied consideration, that we feel, that it  would  not  be  appropriate  toextend the benefits of arrears to  the  respondents,  keeping  in  view  theperiod of limitation, for payment  of  monetary  claims.
