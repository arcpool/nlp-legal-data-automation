If legislative representation can be worked out, as  pointed  outearlier, on the basis of population and if other services  of  the  State  \u2013bureaucracy, police etc. \u2013 can  also  be  similarly  planned,  there  is  noreason at all for the  non-extension  of  this  principle  to  the  judicialservices.

In  other  words,  we  aretalking of citizens with democratic rights  including  right  to  access  tojustice which it is the duty of the State to provide.\u201dThe Report indicated that though the US in 1981  had  one-third  of  India\u2019spopulation, it had a judge to population ratio of one hundred  seven  judgesper million, while in India it was only ten judges  per  million.   The  LawCommission suggested that the  judge  to  population  ratio  be  immediatelyincreased  from  ten  judges  to  fifty  judges  per  million.   The  Reportsuggested that by 2000 India should achieve a  target  of  one  hundred  andseven judges per million (which the US had in 1981).6     If these recommendations had been acted upon India  would  have  judgestrength of 1,10,071 in 2000 (with  the  population  of  1028  million)  and1,36,794 as on 31 December 2015. However, the  sanctioned  strength  of  thejudiciary at all levels on 31 December 2015 was only 21,607.7     This Court in a judgment delivered on  21  March  2002  in  All  IndiaJudges Association v. Union of  India[1]  endorsed  the  views  of  the  LawCommission in its 120th Report and  directed  that  a  judge  to  populationratio of fifty judges per million be achieved within a period of five  yearsand not later than ten years in any case.  This Court observed :\u201cThe increase in the Judge strength to 50 Judges per 10 lakh  people  shouldbe effected and implemented with the filling  up  of  the  posts  in  phasedmanner to be determined and directed by the Union Ministry of Law, but  thisprocess should be completed and the increased  vacancies  and  posts  filledwithin a period of five years  from  today.  Perhaps  increasing  the  Judgestrength by 10 per 10 lakh people every year could be  one  of  the  methodswhich may be adopted thereby completing the first stage  within  five  yearsbefore embarking on further increase if necessary\u201d."

When for any court, the total number of units required  to  be  disposedannually (\u201cbreakeven\u201d plus backlog, if any) is greater than  1.5  times  thedisposal norm for a \u201cvery good performance\u201d judge, a new  court  would  needto be created.\u201d16    While evaluating the  limitations  of  the  rate  of  disposal  methodsuggested by the  Law  Commission  which  have  been  noted  in  the  reportsubmitted by the Chairperson, NCMSC, certain aspects would have to be  bornein mind. The criticism that the rate of disposal method places an  incentiveon lower disposals in certain courts has its own limitations. A  lower  rateof disposal may not necessarily reflect upon the  efficiency  with  which  ajudge has conducted the court. Trials are held up because of  a  paucity  ofpublic prosecutors.  Witnesses  cited  by  the  state,  particularly  policepersonnel, remain absent on dates fixed  for  trial,  resulting  in  delays.Service of summons is delayed because of the laxity of  police.  In  severalnorthern states, particularly, the State of  Uttar  Pradesh  soaring  summertemperatures  have  in  the  absence  of  basic  infrastructural  facilitiesincluding continuous power supply resulted in  the  institutionalization  ofmorning courts in several districts. The convenience of  ordinary  litigantsand witnesses with limited resources, who travel from  afar  without  propermeans of transportation cannot be  disregarded  by  the  presiding  judicialofficer.The   functioning   of   courts   which   lack   even    rudimentaryinfrastructure is affected, as a result. In a number of states, it has  beenthe experience that there are  impediments  faced  by  the  district  courtsincluding strikes of lawyers and abstention from work for  causes  unrelatedto the functioning of the judge or court concerned. The loss of  mandays  onaccount of such causes results in a wastage  of  productive  judicial  time.Hence, it would not be correct to assert that the rate  of  disposal  methodplaces an incentive upon the unproductive or inefficient.  Ground  realitiescannot be ignored merely on the basis of statistics.17    Another aspect which merits emphasis is that while  prescribing  unitsfor disposal, a robust attempt must be made by the  High  Courts  to  ensurethat due importance is given  to  the  disposal  of  old  cases.  The  unitsprescribed for disposal  must  provide  adequate  incentives  to  attend  tocomplex and time consuming cases. Failing this, the out-turn proscribed  forthe district judiciary is attempted to be  achieved  without  due  attentionbeing given to the disposal of those cases which remain pending for long  asa result of their complexity, the number  of  witnesses  involved  and  suchother  factors. This is an aspect which needs to be looked into by the  HighCourts in consultation with the district  judiciary.  District  judges  withlong years of experience in the service are  in  a  position  to  appreciatepractical realities and to indicate the manner in which the unit system  canbe revised in each state to encourage judges  at  both  the  trial  and  theappellate level to take up those  cases  which  consume  judicial  time  andwhich should not be placed on the back-burner for fear that the  judge  willnot be able to  fulfill  the  units  expected.  The  Chief  Justices  shouldinitiate the process of revising unit  based  norms  in  relation  to  theirstates. Each state has its own requirements specific to it which have to  beborne in mind. The unit system must be framed so as to recognize the  outputof judicial officers in disposing of those cases which clog the system.18    In prescribing the judge strength it is necessary  to  ensure  that  abacklog does not result in the future as a result of an increase  in  annualfilings. The rate of increase in  future  filings  has  to  be  anticipated.Anticipation of what  the  future  holds  is  an  estimate.  One  method  ofestimating the extent of the increase in future filings is  to  have  regardto the increase reflected over a comparable period in  the  past  for  whichdata is available. Those  figures  can  be  extrapolated  to  determine  theincrease in annual filings. The enhancement in the strength of the  districtjudiciary should be such that  a  \u2018five  plus  zero\u2019  pendency  is  achieved(wiping out the backlog within a target period of five years).19    In response to  the  recommendations  submitted  by  the  Chairperson,NCMSC, an affidavit has been filed on behalf of the Union of  India  in  theMinistry of Law and Justice.  The Union government has stated that while  itis broadly in agreement with this approach,  the  methodology  suggested  byNCMSC can be adopted subject to certain stipulations. The relevant  part  ofthe response is extracted below :"

                "20    The report which has been submitted to this Court by the  Chairperson,NCMSC observes that in the long term, the judge strength of  the  courts  inthe district judiciary will have to be assessed by a  scientific  method  todetermine the total number of judicial hours required for disposing  of  thecase load of each court.  In the interim, a weighted disposal  approach,  asexplained above has been suggested. Since the Union  government  is  broadlyin agreement with this approach,  we  deem  it  appropriate  and  proper  topermit it to be utilized at this stage for the purpose  of  determining  therequired judge strength of the  district  judiciary.  The  Union  governmenthas, however, suggested two broad stipulations.  The first is that  all  theHigh Courts must make available real time data on the  pendency  of  variouscategories of cases. In this regard, both the NCMSC as well  as  E-Committeeare actively engaging with the High Courts.  An endeavour should be made  toensure that real time data is duly compiled and  made  available  online  bythe High Courts as part of the National Judicial Arrears Grid.  We  are  notinclined to accept the second stipulation that new posts should  be  createdonly after 90 per cent of the sanctioned strength has been filled  up.   Forone thing, filling up of vacancies in the district judiciary is an  on-goingprocess.  In many states, the process of filling  up  posts  is  pursued  inconjunction with the State Public Service Commissions.  Many of  the  delaysare not in the control of the High Courts.  Moreover,  it  is  necessary  toprovide for the required judge strength in every  state  district  judiciaryso as to facilitate the creation of infrastructure.  In several states,  theavailable infrastructure is inadequate and insufficient  to  meet  even  theexisting judge strength. Hence, a  scientific  assessment  of  the  requiredjudge strength will form the basis of ensuring that  the  state  governmentsput into place the infrastructure required for tackling judicial delays."
