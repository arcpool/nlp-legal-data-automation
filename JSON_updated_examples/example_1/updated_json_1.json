In this regard, we may usefully refer  to  the  authority  in  RanbirYadav v. State of Bihar[10] wherein under  certain  circumstances  the  HighCourt had transferred the sessions trial from the court  of  one  AdditionalSessions Judge to another by an administrative order at  a  stage  when  thetrial had commenced.  It was contended before  this  Court  that  the  trialthat took place before the transferee court was wholly without  jurisdictionand consequently the conviction and sentence recorded  by  that  court  werenull and void and were not curable under Section 465 CrPC.  To  sustain  thesaid proposition of law, reliance was placed in A.R. Antulay v.  R.S.  Nayakand another[11].

It further appears that the other  grievance  raised  wasthat the court was so crowded that even  clerks  of  the  lawyers  were  notbeing allowed to enter the courtroom to carry the briefs. Such  a  situationwas obviously created by the trial of a large number of persons.
