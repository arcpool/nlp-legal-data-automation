The learned Senior counsel arguing on behalf of  the revision petitioner begins his argument with a concession that the tenant  will not any longer press the dispute regarding the entitlement of the  CR No. 5474 of 2001                                2  landlord to collect rent and that he would accept him to be his landlord and  not pressforth his plea that Subhash Sethi was the landlord. The learned Sr.  counsel urges two contentions i) if the tenancy for Rs. 2400/- were to be  accepted the Rent Controller ought to have before passing an order for  eviction for non-payment of rent followed the procedure laid down by the  Supreme Court in Rakesh Wadhawan 2002 (1) RCR 514. According to  him the Rent Controller ought to have afforded an opportunity to pay the  rent calculated and without such an opportunity eviction could not have  been issued. The counsel for the petitioner contended that he was ready to  pay the rent and continue the relationship with the landlord. The second  contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the revision petitioner is that a  clause for enhancement of rent at the rate of 10% per year was against  statute. The parties cannot contract themselves out of law and stipulation  for enhancement in the rent deed was invalid. The learned Senior counsel  referred me to the provisions of Section 6 and 7 of the East Punjab Rent  Restriction Act, 1949 which according to him contained a legislative  interdict against enhancement of rent against voluntary enhancement of rent."

To take up the latter point first, Section 6 only lays  down that the landlord cannot claim anything in excess of \"fair rent\"  determined    under the Act as rent i.e. determined by reference to the  procedure under Section 4 of the Act. So long as fair rent is not fixed by  reference to the procedure, the operation of Section 6 of the Act is not  attracted. Similarly reference to Section 7 of the Act is also inappropriate,  for it only bars a landlord to claim any fine or price or any other like sum in  addition to the rent for consideration for the grant, renewal or continuation  of lease. Provisions for enhancement of rent does not fall within the  CR No. 5474 of 2001                                3  boundaries of Section 7."

This proposition finds affirmation in another ruling of this Court in Ashok  Kumar Vs. Rakesh Garg C.R. No. 4202 of 2003 decided on 23.1.2006.  CR No. 5474 of 2001                                4"

                "6.    The residual point for consideration is the  procedural requirement of Court to afford an opportunity to a tenant to pay  rent before order of eviction on the ground of non-payment of rent. It has to  be borne in mind that this was an instance of a case of a tenant who, at all  times before the Rent Controller and the Appellate Authority denied  entitlement of the landlord, the claim to such status and he pleaded jus  tertii. A tenant would be barred by the provisions of Act under Section 116  of the Evidence Act from denying the title of the landlord. The  preponderance of authorities allowing a tenant to plead paramount title in a  third party would be in cases when a tenant is dispossessed at the instance  of a holder of title paramount      and tenant subsequently attorns to the  paramount title holder. In no other occasion would it be possible for a  tenant to deny the jural relationship with his landlord. The legal  consequence of the denial forfeiting      a tenancy is also available under  Section 111 of the Transfer and Property Act but the said Act contains a  distinct procedure for a landlord to act on the forfeiture by having to issue a  notice before taking an action for possession."

The Rent Control legislation stipulates a procedure  which is distinct and the authorities that have dealt with the consequences  of denial of title have a direct bearing to a claim by the tenant that he shall  be given an opportunity to make the payment before eviction could be  ordered. This issue is also no longer res integra. Learned Sr. counsel for  the respondent cites three decisions of this Court that squarely cover the  issue: The decisions in Jagdamba Tea Factory, Amirtsar Vs. Parshotam  2008 (1) RCR 507, Preeti Vs. Manmohan Singh and another 2008 (1)  RCR 307 and 2004 (3) PLR 504 expound the principle that where a tenant  CR No. 5474 of 2001                               5  denied the relationship of landlord and tenant and was not depositing the  rent but the landlord was able to prove relationship of landlord and tenant  during the trial, the tenant was liable for eviction on the ground of non-  payment. He was not required to be given an opportunity to pay rent after  relationship of landlord and tenant was proved. While so laying down the  law, they have also specifically ruled that the procedure laid down in  Rakesh Wadhawan's case (supra) did not apply."

To me,  the contention of the tenant that he was      to pay only Rs. 1500/- was  patently wrong, absurd and untrue. On due consideration of all relevant  materials the Appellate Authority had clearly found that the plea of the  tenant denying the rent deed and setting up title in third party was not bona  fide."
