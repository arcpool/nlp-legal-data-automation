The speeches  made by  the leaders  on February  10,  1990, February 17,  1990, intervening night of February 20 and 21, February 23,  1990 within  the constituency  and on February 24, 1990  outside the  constituency, were  not made with his consent. Therefore,  corrupt practices have not been proved. By reason of the ratio in Manohar Joshi v. Damodar Tatyaba @ Dadasaheb Rupwate  [(1991) 2  SCC 342] [hereinafter referred to as  \"Manohar Joshi  Case No.2\"]  this Court had held that the court  has to  extract pleadings  of corrupt  practices, evidence -  oral and documentary in proof thereof and in the order the  Judge is  required to  indicate portions  of  his findings of the speaker appealing to the voters on the basis of religion  etc. The  court should  supply  the  pleadings, evidence - oral and documentary and the copy of the order so as to  enable notice to adequately meet the ground on which he is  proposed to  be named  in the  order. This  mandatory requirement has  not  been  complied  with.  Therefore,  the judgment is  clearly illegal.  He, therefore,  requested  to remit the  matter for  taking the  proceedings under Section 99(1) proviso  as interpreted  in Manohar  Joshi Case  No.2. Shri B.A.  Desai, learned  counsel for the respondent,  has controverted the same."

Background  facts to  the said  decision  are required to  be stated here. In  Election Petition  No.1 of 1988 which is the subject matter of the above appeal, at the close of  the trial,  by order dated September 23, 1988, the learned Judge while holding that notice under Section 99 was necessary, the court reached  prima facie  finding that the charges alleged  in the  petition of  the corrupt  practices under Section  123 [3] and 123 [3A] have been proved against the named  persons and directed notice to them to show cause why they should not be so named in the order of the election petition; the  notice indicated that the named persons shall have opportunity  to  cross-examine  the  witnesses  already examined at  the trial and gave evidence against him and of calling  evidence   in his  defence  and  of  being  heard. Accompanying  the   notice,  photocopies  of  the  petition, written statement,  the issues,  the  evidence -  oral  and documentary were  supplied. In furtherance thereof, Shri Bal Thackeray had  appeared on  September 27, 1988 and contended that the  notice was vague since the notice did not indicate as to  which portions  of the  speeches  were  believed  and relied upon  to reach prima facie conclusion. By order dated October 10, 1988, the learned Judge overruled the objections by a  written order  which was challenged in  Special Leave Petition No.13163  of 1988.  A Bench  of two  Judges of this Court by order dated December 1, 1988 dismissed the petition holding that  notice under  Section 99 was not  required to specify all  the portions  of the  speeches indicated  to be corrupt practices under sub-sections [3] and [3A] of Section"

The Bench had held  that \"it  is difficult to visualize what prejudice was caused  to the  notice on  these facts  and  how  there should be  any non  - compliance  of Section  99  of  the Representation of  the People Act in this situation\" and it was held  that, in  short, the opportunity which a party to the petition  had at  the trial  to  defend  allegations  of corrupt practices  is to  be given  by such a notice to that person of  defending himself  if he was not already a  party to the petition. In  other words,  the notice has  to  be equated with  a party  to the  petition for this purpose and has to be given  the same opportunity which he would get of he was made a party to the petition. This is the pragmatic test to  be applied  for deciding the question of compliance of requirements  of Section  99, the opportunity required to be given  by virtue of proviso to sub-section [1] of Section 99 is  the same  and not more than that available to a party to the petition to  defend himself  in respect  of  corrupt practices.
