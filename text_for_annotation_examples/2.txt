The petitioner seeks for various reliefs including a direction to callfor the original of Ext.P5 document and to quash the same.@@@@@

2.@@@@@The challenge is against the cancellation deed said to have beenexecuted unilaterally, purportedly to cancel Ext.P1 document.@@@@@As perExt.P1 document, the petitioner's mother Eli settled her properties to herchildren and the petitioner obtained a total extent of 31.75 cents of landcomprised in Sy. No.1026/6 of Kothamangalam Village.@@@@@Ext.P2 is thereceipt showing payment of land tax, dated 11.5.2011 and Ext.P3 is thecopy of the possession certificate issued by the Village Officer showingthat the petitioner is in possession of the said property.@@@@@

3.@@@@@In connection with an application for availing a bank loan, thepetitioner applied for an encumbrance certificate and Ext.P4 is the copy ofthe said certificate.@@@@@It contains an endorsement that Ext.P1 has beencancelled.@@@@@Thereafter, the petitioner obtained a copy of the cancellationW.p(c).@@@@@No.35040/2012                                    -:2:-deed which is produced as Ext.P5.@@@@@The date of Ext.P5 is 1.4.2003.According to the petitioner, the mother was completely laid up at that timeand she finally expired on 25.7.2003 and she was not in a position toexecute any document.@@@@@The allegation is that this document was registeredat the instance of the third respondent.@@@@@

4.@@@@@Pursuant to the notice issued by this Court, the third respondenthas entered appearance.@@@@@

5.@@@@@Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned GovernmentPleader and learned counsel for the third respondent.@@@@@

6.@@@@@Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon a decision of thisCourt in Noble John v. State of Kerala (2010 (3) KLT 941).@@@@@The questionconsidered therein is identical.@@@@@After elaborately considering variousaspects, this Court laid down the principle thus in para 10:@@@@@
"If a person is not entitled to transferable property, he cannot            execute a document in respect of transfer of the property and            therefore he is not a person competent to present such a            document for registration.@@@@@Under sub-clause VII of R.191 of the            Rules, the Sub-Registrar can validly refuse registration of a            document if it is presented by a person who has no right to            present it.@@@@@By cancelling a sale deed executed by him earlier, the            vendor is actually attempting to re-transfer the property toW.p(c).@@@@@No.35040/2012                                 -:3:-        himself, which he cannot do, since he is no longer entitled to that        property as the title had already passed to the purchaser on the        execution of the sale deed unless the sale deed stipulates        otherwise and for becoming entitled to be competent to execute a        document in respect of that property he has to first get the earlier        sale deed annulled by a court of law.@@@@@On reading of all these        provisions together, I am satisfied that a Registering Authority        can refuse registration, if, on a cursory enquiry, it is clear that the        person purporting to have executed the cancellation deed is not        the person entitled to the property as on the date of execution.@@@@@This he can easily do by merely looking at the document and the        previous documents registered in respect of the property as per        the register available in his office in respect of the property,        which would show who is the present owner of the property.@@@@@S.@@@@@


35 of the Act indicates that such an enquiry is not alien to the        powers and duties of the Sub-Registrar.@@@@@Going by S.34 of the        Indian Registration Act and R.67 of the Registration Rules        (Kerala), at first blush it may appear that the Registering Officer        cannot enquire into the validity of the document or the right of        the executing party to execute the document.@@@@@But to hold that        under no circumstances the Registering Officer shall enquire into        the competency of the person to execute the document and he        shall blindly register the document except for the reasons        mentioned in R.191, would lead to very disastrous and        anomalous results.@@@@@A reasonable interpretation commensurate        with the object of the Act and Rules would be that if by readingW.p(c).@@@@@No.35040/2012                                    -:4:-            the document and looking at the previous documents registered            in respect of the property he is satisfied that the document cannot            be validly executed by the person purporting to have executed            the same, he has to refuse to register the same and act in            accordance with S.71 of the Act.@@@@@By refusing to register a deed            of cancellation of a sale deed, the Sub Registrar is only            performing a duty cast upon him by the Registration Act and            Rules, notwithstanding R.67 of the Registration Rules (Kerala)            and the same is in consonance with the object of the Registration            Act and Rules."@@@@@

It was held that the Registering Authority can refuse registration, if, on acursory enquiry, it is clear that the person purporting to have executed thecancellation deed is not the person entitled to the property as on the date ofexecution.@@@@@

7.@@@@@Evidently, in this case the said principles will apply.@@@@@As on thedate of execution of the cancellation deed, Ext.P1 deed has already comeinto effect and the petitioner has already obtained possession as well as titleto the property.@@@@@These aspects have not been disputed by the thirdrespondent also.@@@@@The executant of Ext.P5 had no right at all.@@@@@

8.@@@@@In that view of the matter, there will be a declaration that theregistration of the original of Ext.P5 is not legal and valid and therefore theoriginal of the same will stand set aside.@@@@@There will be a direction toW.p(c).@@@@@No.35040/2012                                    -:5:-respondents 1 and 2 to effect suitable entries in that regard in the variousregisters maintained in the Office, of the Sub Registrar, Kothamangalamand thereafter issue a fresh encumbrance certificate to the petitioner interms of the declaration made as above.@@@@@The petitioner will produce acertified copy of this judgment for compliance.@@@@@

The writ petition is allowed as above.@@@@@No costs.@@@@@
